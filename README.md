# Introduction to Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) - GECCO 2025 Tutorial

This repository contains the tutorial materials for the **Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) tutorial** presented at **GECCO 2025**. The tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to CGP through a simple, educational implementation built from scratch.

## üìñ About This Tutorial

Cartesian Genetic Programming is a form of genetic programming that represents programs as directed acyclic graphs. This tutorial covers:

- **CGP representation**: Linear genome encoding computational graphs
- **Evolution**: Simple (1+Œª) evolutionary strategy 
- **Applications**: Symbolic regression and reinforcement learning policy evolution
- **Implementation**: Complete CGP system built from scratch in Python

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will understand:
- How CGP represents programs as graphs with linear genomes
- The role of active and inactive nodes in CGP
- How to apply CGP to symbolic regression problems
- How to evolve policies for reinforcement learning tasks

## üìö Tutorial Structure

The main tutorial is contained in the Jupyter notebook:

- **`cgp_tutorial.ipynb`** - Complete tutorial with theory and hands-on examples

### Topics Covered:

1. **Representation** - CGP's graph-based program representation
2. **Random Initialization** - Creating random CGP programs
3. **Active vs Inactive Nodes** - Understanding program execution flow
4. **Mutation** - Point mutation and neutral evolution
5. **Evolution** - Simple (1+Œª) evolutionary algorithm
6. **Example 1**: Symbolic regression (evolving f(x,y) = x¬≤ + y¬≤)
7. **Example 2**: Reinforcement learning (Mountain Car policy evolution)
